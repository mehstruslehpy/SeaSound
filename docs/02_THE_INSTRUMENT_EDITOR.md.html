<h1 id="the-instrument-editor.">The Instrument Editor.</h1>
<h2 id="the-instrument-interface-overview.">The Instrument Interface Overview.</h2>
<p>On clicking the instrument editor tab button at the top of the screen you are presented with the following user interface:</p>
<p><img src="./02_IMAGES/02_OPENING_THE_INSTRUMENT_TAB.png" /></p>
<p>From left to right we describe the controls shown in this image:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Loaded instruments may be selected via the drop down to the right of the “Select Instrument:” label. Since no instruments are loaded on startup the NULL instrument is the only loaded instrument.</li>
<li>The button to the right of the instrument drop down can be used to delete the currently selected instrument.</li>
<li>The drop down to the right of the “New Instrument:” label can be used to select the type of instrument creation mode to use to create the next instrument. Currently the only supported modes for instrument creation are “Graph” and “Text” modes.</li>
<li>The text box to the right of the “New Instrument:” mode drop down is used to specify the name of the next instrument to be created.</li>
<li>The “Add” button is used to create a new instrument based on the name and mode specified previously. When this is pressed the new instrument is added to the “Select Instrument:” drop down and you can then select and begin editing the instrument.</li>
<li>The “Node Config” button is specific to the graph mode interface. Selecting this button opens up a modal used to configure nodes for the currently selected instrument. We will discuss this more in a later section.</li>
<li>The “Render Instr” button generates csound code for the selected instrument and displays it in a resizeable dialog window.</li>
<li>The “Render Orch” button does the same thing but shows all instruments.</li>
<li>The “Save Instr” button saves and downloads the currently selected instrument to a .synth file using your browsers default download settings.</li>
<li>The “Load Instr” button can be used to load an instrument from files saved in the previous step.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="text-mode-instrument-creation.">Text Mode Instrument Creation.</h2>
<p>To create a new instrument using the text mode interface, as described above, we can input a name such as “MyTextSynth” into the text field, select “Text” from the drop down and click the “Add” button. Doing this results in the following interface.</p>
<p><img src="./02_IMAGES/02_TEXT_SYNTH_EXAMPLE.png" /></p>
<p>From here you may input any valid csound orchestra code into the text box to create the “MyTextSynth” instrument.</p>
<h2 id="graph-mode-instrument-creation.">Graph Mode Instrument Creation.</h2>
<p>To create a new instrument using the graph mode interface, as described above, we can input a name such as “MyGraphSynth” into the text field, select “Graph” from the drop down and click the “Add” button. Doing this results in the following interface.</p>
<p><img src="./02_IMAGES/02_GRAPH_SYNTH_EXAMPE_1.png" /></p>
<p>The canvas that has now been added to the page can be interacted with via keyboard and mouse. Importantly, take note of the text shown at the top right corner of the canvas. Information about the current mode of the canvas as well as a reminder of how to access canvas specific keybinds is shown here.</p>
<h3 id="the-graph-canvas-interface.">The Graph Canvas Interface.</h3>
<p>The basic idea of the graph canvas interface is that we can construct graph theoretic (i.e., node/edge diagrams) to describe our csound instruments. If you click around in the empty canvas created by the previously mentioned steps you will see that nodes are created at the coordinates of your mouse click.</p>
<p>By pressing h with the instrument canvas in focus (i.e. clicked on) a quick reference menu showing the canvas keybinds is displayed.</p>
<p><img src="./02_IMAGES/02_KEYBINDS.png" /></p>
<h4 id="the-keybinds-work-as-follows">The keybinds work as follows:</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li>The numbers 1, 2 and 3 are used to change the mode of the editor. There are three modes for the graph canvas: instrument, node and edge mode which we will describe below.</li>
<li>The n key is a control which allows the “name” of a node to be changed quickly where necessary.</li>
<li>wasd keys are used for panning the viewport of the canvas around.</li>
<li>qe keys allow the viewport to be zoomed in/out.</li>
<li>rf and tg keys change the amount that panning and zooming occurs by respectively.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="the-three-basic-modes-of-the-editor-are">The three basic modes of the editor are:</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li>Node mode: In node mode mouse clicks are used to draw nodes to the screen.</li>
<li>Edge mode: In edge mode inputs and outputs of nodes (which will be explained more shortly) can be connected together by clicking the mouse on the desired input/output and then making a sequence of clicks in the canvas ending at the desired final connection point. This draws an edge consisting of a sequence of line segments (called a “polyline”) connecting the starting input/output to the ending input/output.</li>
<li>Delete mode: In this mode clicking on an edge or node causes that edge or node to be deleted from the current instrument.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="nodes.">Nodes.</h4>
<p>A typical node looks like the following.</p>
<p><img src="./02_IMAGES/02_EXAMPLE_NODE.png" /></p>
<p>The blue rectangles at the top represent the inputs to the node. The multicolored rectangles at the bottom represent the outputs of the node. The different colors of the outputs represent the different output variable type that corresponds to that output. The text between the two rectangles represents the “name” of the node.</p>
<h4 id="node-types.">Node Types.</h4>
<p>There are two types of nodes supported by the editor so far. Functional and macro. With functional nodes (the default) a node is rendered to a line of csound code in the form <code>&lt;node_outputs&gt; &lt;node_name&gt;(&lt;node_inputs&gt;)</code> using csound functional syntax. The graph canvas takes care to work out the appropriate inputs and outputs along with their types to the node itself based on the connections you drew on the screen. Note that what I mean by this is that the naming of variables under the hood in the emitted csound code is handled for you, but nothing is stopping you from such mistakes as connecting up an output of one type to an incompatible input of another type.</p>
<p>With macro nodes code is rendered in the following form <code>&lt;node_outputs&gt; &lt;node_name&gt;</code> where the node name is any text. This may seem odd at first, but the macro mode (as the name implies) supports a simple macro find and replace facility. In the textual name of the node, any occurrence of the text <span class="citation" data-cites="n">@n</span> is replaced by the corresponding variable of the nth input. So, if a node has the string “= mySillyOpcode <span class="citation" data-cites="3">@3</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="1">@1</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="2">@2</span>” and <span class="citation" data-cites="3">@3</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="1">@1</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="2">@2</span> correspond to inputs var3, var1 and var2 the emitted code will be something of the form <code>&lt;node_outputs&gt; = mySillyOpcode var3 var2 var1</code>.</p>
<h4 id="configuring-nodes-and-the-node-dialog.">Configuring Nodes and The Node Dialog.</h4>
<p>In order to configure a node for the currently selected instrument you may press the “node config” described above. Doing so pops up the following dialog.</p>
<p><img src="./02_IMAGES/02_NODE_MODAL_UNFILLED.png" /></p>
<p>The controls of this dialog are explained as follows: 1. The node name field is where you can input a name for the node you wish to create. 2. The inputs field is where you specify the number of inputs your node will accept. 3. The output types field is where you specify the number and types of outputs of your node. The outputs of a node are specified in a comma separated list containing the csound variable prefix pertaining to the type of each output. For example, if you create outputs as shown in the figure above the result will be a node with an a-rate, k-rate and i-rate output (in that order). 4. The output style dropdown is where you can choose between functional and macro mode for the given node. 5. The cancel button closes the node config dialog. 6. The okay button confirms the node being configured. After clicking confirm the graph canvas is configured so that the node you designed in the node config can now be input into your graph the next time you right click in node mode in the canvas. You should also see the text at the top right of the canvas has changed to reflect your inputs in the node config.</p>
<h4 id="graph-to-node-translation.">Graph To Node Translation.</h4>
<p>We distinguish between two types of nodes here. Nodes with no inputs are considered to be input nodes, i.e. they are nodes which produce values as inputs to other nodes but receive no inputs themselves. Similarly nodes with no outputs are considered output nodes, i.e. other nodes output to them, but they do not output to any other nodes.</p>
<p>After you are finished constructing your desired instrument in the graph canvas you may render the instrument. The rendering process constructs the code corresponding to your instrument by iterating across the list of output nodes and generating the code corresponding to that output node.</p>
<p>For each output node, code generation occurs by a depth first traversal of the graph of nodes connected to that output node all the way to the connected input nodes (but nodes which have already been printed so far are skipped). During this traversal code for a given node is generated in post order (i.e. after all the connected nodes have been fully traversed). This ensures lines of input code are emitted first, before generating code that depends on the previously mentioned input code.</p>
<p>Note that if no output nodes are specified in your graph diagram, then the graph canvas will output no code at all.</p>
<h4 id="some-quirks.">Some Quirks.</h4>
<p>As of right now, I do not know a good way to support certain more in depth features such as control statements and jumps that exist in csound code. Additionally, my code does not allow for controlling the order in which code for the nodes are generated beyond what is already described above.</p>
<p>So, although the graph canvas method is more visually appealing and user friendly the inputting csound instrument code by hand, this method is somewhat more limited in ability compared to the text method. For instances where deep instrument control is required it may be better to directly code your instrument in text using the methods described above.</p>
<h4 id="an-exercise.">An Exercise.</h4>
<p>As an exercise, attempt to construct the instrument shown below in the graph canvas interface.</p>
<p><img src="./02_IMAGES/02_EXERCISE.png" /></p>
<p>You may check your work by comparing it to the code shown below when the “Rendr Instr” button is pressed.</p>
<pre><code>instr synthinstrument
    i_1_0 = p5
    i_0_0 = p4
    i_2_0 = cpspch(i_0_0)
    a_3_0 = vco2(i_1_0, i_2_0)
    out(a_3_0, a_3_0)
endin</code></pre>
<p>Hint: The variable name prefixes in the code above tell you the correct variable types to use in the node config dialog for each node.</p>
