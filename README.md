## Installation
As of right now to develop and use this program my machine runs: Firefox 114.0.2, Python 3.8.10, Flask 2.2.2, Werkzeug 2.2.2 along with Bash. To build the docs I am using pandoc 2.5 and jsdoc 4.0.3.

## Start-up
Run `make` and navigate to the address in your browser that is specified by flask at the terminal.
